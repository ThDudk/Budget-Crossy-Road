# Budget-Crossy-Road

## Description
A small 2d Crossy Road remake in Unity. This project was created to learn Unity and is a simple 1-1 (minus a few features) remake of Crossy Road.

If you want to access the spritesheet I made for this project, the sprites can be found for free on [my itch.io page](https://thdudk.itch.io/crossy-road-2d-sprites)

Note: because this was a project to learn the engine, I have no intention of supporting it in the future.
